title:  "How engge and Thimblewed Park starts!"

## The boot process

First thing first, engge use Thimbleweed park ggpack files, theses files are archives and contains all the resources: images, scripts, text files, music, sounds etc.

The first thing to understand is Thimbleweed Park use [squirrel](http://squirrel-lang.org/) scripts. Actually it uses a modified version of squirrel, why ? Because this language lacks some useful functionnalities like:

* script keyword
* multilines lambda
* rawsafeget method
* optional while condition
* else after statement
* implicit boolean to integer conversion

OK let's go back to how Thimblewed Park starts:

* it executes the script file called _Defines.nut_, in this file there a several constants and macros defined
* then it executes the _Boot.nut_ script, this script does a lot of things, the most important part is the inclusion of all other script files like _DefineSounds.nut_, _DefineRooms.nut_ and _DefineActors.nut_

When these scripts are executed, all the game is ready to start. The main function to start the game is called **start**:
`function start(do_opening)`
As you imagine if you call start with true as argument, then you will have the opening sentence played.

For engge, it's a little bit different, the program checks first if the _test.nut_ is present next to the executable and executes it, if not, it does the same thing as Thimbleweed Park, it will execute _Defines.nut_ and _Boot.nut_ scripts. This solution allows me to test my engines and start the game where I want.

## test.nut example

Here is an example a script which allow to skip the opening and start the game with Ray in the main street:

```squirrel
include("Defines.nut")
include("Boot.nut")

inputOn()
inputVerbs(ON)
selectActor(ray)
enterRoomFromDoor(highwayMainStreetDoor)
```
