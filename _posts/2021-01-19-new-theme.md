Yeah, why not starting a new year with a new theme ?

## A new theme
OK, this year I decided to change my blog and I start with a new theme: [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes), fantastic no ?

You didn't believe I was able to create a blog like this on my own and you're right!!
Why do I ask, I'm alone on this blog ðŸ˜ƒ

## What next this year ?
Hmmm, I didn't write too much posts last year, so why not change this ?
So what's the plan this year about engge:
- lighting shader!! As explained in the [previous post](../lighting), I worked on lighting shader, and it will be available for the next release 0.7.0.
- a new graphic framework, I will replace SFML by my own framework based on SDL2, [check the repo](https://github.com/scemino/EnggeFramework).
- with a framework based on SDL2, it will be simpler to add input controllers support
- and bug fixes, hooray
