After 2 years of coding other stuffs, I'm back to this project, but with a new plan.
<!--more-->

## Introduction

OK back to the basics, this time I want to go further than last time, and implement features not implemented in the first attempt.

This time I want:

* background animations: background fading and lights animations
* no more scripting, the idea is nice, but it was more a constraint than an advantage
* limit data size: images and sounds

## The master plan

To achieve my goals here is my plan:

* background(s) with tiles
* background animations
* ship movement
* sprite animations
* collision detection
* bullets
* particles: muzzle flash, bullet impact
* enemy spawning
* enemy hit blinking
* implement an audio mixer: to play music and multiple sounds at the same time

## Backgrounds

I won't explain how to create a whole level with only this texture:

If you don't have the answer, you can have a look at my old post: [Let's make a shoot-em-up!](/rtype).
