Here is a small summary of my projects of the year 2023.

During this year I worked on 2 projects:

- a Thomson MO5 Emulator

- a rewrite of Another World (game by Eric Chahi)

## Thomson MO5 Emulator

The `Thomson MO5` was my first computer. It had a Motorola 6809E processor clocked at 1 MHz, so I could play with it a bit, but it also gave me an early start in programming.
With a touch of nostalgia and thanks to the magnificent [chips](https://github.com/floooh/chips) project, I've been able to create a MO5 emulator that can be used online [here](https://scemino.github.io/yame_wp/).

It allows me to play the various games I grew up playing.

## Another World rewrite

In the same vein, I've written a program that lets you play `Another World` directly from your browser [here](https://scemino.github.io/raw_wp/).
To play it, you'll need to zip up the game `Another World` and drop it into your browser.

First of all, a word about Another World, the cult game created by Eric Chahi in 1991, an action/adventure game that made a big impression at the time thanks to its graphics and, above all, its animations and cinematic scenes.

As the game is really interesting to study, I wanted to include a debugger to help you better understand how it works.
