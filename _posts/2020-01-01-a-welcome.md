## Welcome

The goal of this blog is to explain what I discovered when building engge and how it works.
Be kind, this is a work in progress and as you can read english is not my primary language :)

## What is engge

Oops I forgot to explain what is engge.
engge is an adventure game engine and supports playing Thimbleweed Park.

The engine is written in C++ and is cross platform. You must have a legally purchased copy of Thimbleweed Park installed on your computer in order to run that game on this engine.
