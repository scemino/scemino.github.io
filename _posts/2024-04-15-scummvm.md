I've been working on integrating `Thimbleweed Park` into `ScummVM`.
I'd been approached a while back about integrating `engge` into `ScummVM`, but didn't feel ready at the time.

I started working on this integration in December 2023 and regularly post my progress on youtube.

It all began with a POC (proof of concept):

See the full [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEWKzA7f3DYmyu64_4pnk6yMqhcN7Psoi&feature=shared).

Later, the `ScummVM` team warmly invited me to join their team, which I gladly accepted.

In the course of this work, I've been able to improve some of the shortcomings present in `engge` and `engge2`, and the game should now be faster in certain phases of the game (notably in the library), while the shader handling the lighting has also been improved + various small enhancements.

I hope this will please some of you, and don't hesitate to leave me a comment if you wish.

More in the next episode.
