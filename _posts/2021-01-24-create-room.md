In this post I will explain how to create a room for _Thimbleweed Park_, more precisely I will create the Scumm Bar of _The Secret of Monkey Island_.
<!--more-->

# The steps

Here is a video of the new room that we will create (without the dialogs, maybe it will be in another tutorial).

{% include video id="5Ww9gvgcrfc" provider="youtube" %}

The steps to create the new room:
* install the tools
* create your spritesheet
* create the room
* create the room script
* pack the files

# Prerequisites

To accomplish our task, you will need theses tools:
* _Thimbleweed Park_ (this is obvious)
* Images from _Monkey Island 1_
* [**TexturePacker**](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) to create a spritesheet from images
* [**WimpyViewer**](https://github.com/scemino/EnggeFramework/tree/main/demos/WimpyViewer): a tool to edit room for _Thimbleweed Park_
* [**ggpack tools**](https://github.com/fzipp/gg): to pack all files, rooms, images, scripts and so on for _Thimbleweed Park_, this will create a `ThimbleweedPark.ggpack1` file.

**Watch out!** Before starting, make a copy of your original [ThimbleweedPark.ggpack1](#) file
{: .notice--warning}

# Create your spritesheet

Run Texture Packer or use can use a free alternative like  [**Free Texture Packer**](http://free-tex-packer.com)

Drag and drop all your images, you should have something like this

![spritesheet](/assets/images/spritesheet.png)

Be sure to validate this:
* Data format: JSON (Hash)
* Data file: `ScummBarSheet.json`
* Trim sprite names

![options_format](/assets/images/options_format.png)

* Allow rotation: unchecked

![options_rotation](/assets/images/options_rotation.png)

Then click on `Publish sprite sheet`, you should have now 2 files: `ScummBarSheet.json` and `ScummBarSheet.png`

ðŸ¥³ Congratulations ðŸ¥³, the first part is done.

# Create the room

Before creating the room you need to setup your environment, first we need to create a specific folder structure like this:

![room_directories](/assets/images/room_directories.png)

* **Wimpy**: this is where you create your room file
* **SpriteSheets**: this folder contains the spritesheet files
* **Scripts**: this one contains the room scripts

## Create the room template

Create a file and name it `ScummBar.wimpy` and paste this:
```json
{
  "background": "background",
  "fullscreen": 2,
  "height": 172,
  "name": "ScummBar",
  "objects": [],
  "roomsize": "{640,240}",
  "scaling": [
    "0.6@89",
    "0.6@118"
  ],
  "sheet": "ScummBarSheet",
  "walkboxes": []
}
```

Then run `WimpyViewer` and drag and drop your wimpy file into it, you should see an empty room like this:

![wimpy_empty](/assets/images/wimpy_empty.png)

## Create the objects

Go in the menu `Edit` and select `New object...` or use the shortcut `N`

![wimpy_create_object](/assets/images/wimpy_create_object.png)

Rename it `scummBarDoor`, don't change the following properties.

And here starts the fun part.

Go in the menu `Edit` and select `Edit Animations...` or use the shortcut `A`, click on `New...` and type `state0`, start again and create a `state1`.

![wimpy_define_states](/assets/images/wimpy_define_states.png)

In `Animation states` window, you have all the images declared in your spritesheet.
Drag and drop from `Animation states` window `obj_322` into `state1`, like this.

![wimpy_drag_image](/assets/images/wimpy_drag_image.png)

Nothing has changed, but... if you click in the background and press key `2`, now you should see the door opened, cool no?

![wimpy_states](/assets/images/wimpy_states.png)

You need to change the property of the object to `Prop` in order to move the door to the correct position.

![wimpy_pos_door](/assets/images/wimpy_pos_door.png)

And now once again if you click in the background, you can test the different states by pressing key `1` and key `2`, it will set the state of the door to `state0` (closed) and `state1` (door) respectively.

![wimpy_anim_door](/assets/images/wimpy_anim_door.gif)

Now we will define the hotspot for this door, but first what is a hotspot?
A hotspot is the rectangular area where the mouse cursor will detect the object, here the door.

![wimpy_hotspot](/assets/images/wimpy_hotspot.png)

First, we need to unset the object as a `Prop`. Why? Because if your object is a `Prop` you won't be able to interact with this object in the game.
Then we can edit the hotspot by clicking one of the handles and you need to define the `use position`, this position specify where the actor will move if you click on this object.

Finally, we have to define the direction of the actor when he will reach the object's position, in our example we will see the back of the actor, so we need to define the `use direction` to `Back`.

![wimpy_usedir](/assets/images/wimpy_usedir.png)

## Create the wakboxes

What is a walkbox?

    A walbox is a polygon where an actor (a character of the game) is able to walk.

Go to the menu `View` and select `Show walkbox Info...` and click on the `New walkbox` button in the `Walkbox Info` window. And now go to the `Edit` menu and select `Edit walkboxes` or shortcut `W`.

![wimpy_new_walkbox](/assets/images/wimpy_new_walkbox.png)

Now you can edit the handle of the walkbox, but 4 points are not enough to create our walkbox, you will need to add other points, to do this click on the right mouse button where you want to insert your point in the walkbox.
To remove a point, click on the right mouse button on a point.

You should now be able to create a walkbox like this:

![wimpy_walkbox](/assets/images/wimpy_walkbox.png)

Now save your room, and that's it for wimpy!

# Create the room script

Create a script file named `ScummBar.nut` with its minimal content:
```lua
ScummBar <- 
{
 background = "ScummBar"
 enter = function(door) 
 {
 }
 exit = function()
 {
 }
}
```

A `.nut` file is a squirrel script file, squirrel is a language similar to `lua`.
In this file, we declare a table called `ScummBar` (the name of the room), we defined a property `background` set to `ScummBar` and 2 functions `enter` and `exit`, when the room becomes the current room, the `enter` function is called.

Now we want to be able to interact with the door, to do this we need to declare inside the room, a table, this table should be named `scummBarDoor`, the exact same name as we declare the door in the wimpy file.

```lua
scummBarDoor =
{
    name = "door"
    flags = DOOR_BACK
    defaultVerb = VERB_OPEN
    autoclose = YES
}
```

The property `name` defined the text that the cursor will display when it will be over the door's hotspot.
`flags` set to `DOOR_BACK` indicates the direction of the cursor when it will be over it.

The property `defaultVerb` is handy to use a quickly an action, when you press the right mouse button button on the door, it will open it when `defaultVerb` is set to `VERB_OPEN`.

`autoclose` is specific to a door object, when an actor open the door, the door will be automatically closed after.

Now we need to define what to do if we execute the `VERB_OPEN` on this door, and what to do if we execute `VERB_CLOSE`, you can also add what to do when the actor walks directly to the door, and he would be useful to exit from the current room to go to the other one (in this example, we will go to the main street).

```lua
verbOpen = function()
{
    openDoors(this, MainStreet.mainStreetDinerDoor)
}
verbClose = function()
{
    closeDoors(this, MainStreet.mainStreetDinerDoor)
}
verbWalkTo = function()
{
    exitRoomFromDoor(this, MainStreet.mainStreetDinerDoor)
}
```

If you want your player be able to talk to someone, just add a table to the "object" you want to talk to:

```lua
pirate4 =
{
    name = "pirate"
    flags = TALKABLE
    defaultVerb = VERB_TALKTO
    verbTalkTo = function() {
        sayLine("I don't think it's wise to wake a sleeping pirate.")
    }
}
```

You have to set the property `flags` to `TALKABLE` to be able to talk to this pirate, set the `defaultVerb` to `VERB_TALKTO` and now you can decide what to do when the actor talks to this pirate.
In this example, we want the actor to say "I don't think it's wise to wake a sleeping pirate.".
Nice ðŸ˜Ž

OK now you have enough information to add the other interactions.
Here is my final script:

```lua
ScummBar <- 
{
    background = "ScummBar"
    enter = function(door) 
    {
        loopObjectState(chandelier, 0)
        loopObjectState(chain, 0)
        loopObjectState(fire, 0)
        loopObjectState(pirate1, 0)
        loopObjectState(pirate2, 0)
        loopObjectState(pirate3, 0)
        loopObjectState(pirate4, 0)
        loopObjectState(pirate5, 0)
        loopObjectState(pirate6, 0)
        loopObjectState(pirate7, 0)
        loopObjectState(pirate8, 0)
        loopObjectState(pirate9, 0)
        loopObjectState(dog, 0)
    }
    exit = function()
    {
    }

    chandelier =
    {
    }
    fire =
    {
    }
    pirate4 =
    {
        name = "pirate"
        flags = TALKABLE
        defaultVerb = VERB_TALKTO
        verbTalkTo = function() {
            sayLine("I don't think it's wise to wake a sleeping pirate.")
        }
    }
    pirate5 =
    {
        name = "pirates"
        flags = TALKABLE
        defaultVerb = VERB_TALKTO
        verbTalkTo = function() {
            sayLine("I don't want to bother them.","They're busy listening to the guy on the left.")
        }
    }
    pirate8 =
    {
        name = "pirate"
        flags = TALKABLE
        defaultVerb = VERB_TALKTO
        verbTalkTo = function() {
            sayLine("I think they're busy.")
        }
    }
    pirate9 =
    {
        name = "pirate"
        flags = TALKABLE
        defaultVerb = VERB_TALKTO
        verbTalkTo = function() {
            sayLine("I don't think it's wise to wake a sleeping pirate.")
        }
    }
    dog =
    {
        name = "dog"
        flags = TALKABLE
        defaultVerb = VERB_TALKTO
        verbTalkTo = function() {
            sayLine(dog,"Grrrr.")
        }
    }

    scummBarDockDoor =
    {
        name = "door"
        flags = DOOR_BACK
        defaultVerb = VERB_OPEN
        autoclose = YES
        verbLookAt = function()
        {
            sayLine("It's a door.")
        }
        verbPickUp = function()
        {
            sayLine("I can't! It's been glued to the floor.")
        }
        verbUse = function(obj=null)
        {
            sayLine("No way!")
        }
        verbWalkTo = function()
        {
            exitRoomFromDoor(this, Dock.dockScummBarDoor)
        }
        verbOpen = function()
        {
            openDoors(this, Dock.dockScummBarDoor)
        }
        verbClose = function()
        {
            closeDoors(this, Dock.dockScummBarDoor)
        }
        verbPush = function()
        {
            verbOpen()
        }
        verbPull = function()
        {
            noReach()
            sayLine("There's no handle on the door.")
        }
    }
}
```

# Pack the files

The first time, you'll need to extract all the files from `ThimbleweedPark.ggpack1` in a directory.
In this tutorial I will use `ggpack tools`:

`ggpack -extract "*" ThimbleweedPark.ggpack1`

Now in this directory, don't forget to copy our new room files:
* `ScummBarSheet.json`
* `ScummBarSheet.png`
* `ScummBar.wimpy`
* `ScummBar.nut` (rename it to `ScummBar.bnut`)

We are almost done, we need to declare our room in the `DefineRooms.bnut`, add this statement:

```lua
include("ScummBar.nut")
defineRoom(ScummBar)
```

Now we want to start the game directly in the ScummBar, edit the `boot.bnut` and locate this code:

```lua
if (do_opening) {
  g.openingScene = 1
  startglobalthread(newOpeningScene)
  return
}
```

Modify it to:

```lua
if (do_opening) {
  g.openingScene = 1
  //startglobalthread(newOpeningScene)
  startglobalthread(enterScummBar)
  return
}
```

And add this code before

```lua
 script enterScummBar() {
  actorSlotSelectable(ray, ON)
  actorSlotSelectable(reyes, ON)
  actorSlotSelectable(ON)
  cameraInRoom(ScummBar)
  actorAt(ray, ScummBar.scummBarDoor)
  selectActor(ray)
  cameraFollow(ray)
  inputVerbs(ON)
  inputOn()
}
```

it's time to pack all files

`ggpack -create "*" ThimbleweedPark.ggpack1`

**Watch out!** Before executing the next step, make a copy of your original [ThimbleweedPark.ggpack1](#) file
{: .notice--warning}

Move or copy this file to your game directory.

Et voilÃ , I hope you enjoyed it as mush as I did, don't hesitate to share your remarks in the comments and please let me know if you create your own room, it would be amazing.
Don't be shy if you have any questions, I will try to answer them, or if you want more tutorials let me know.
